# Repository Strategy and Layout

Use this document when you need to understand **where** code lives or **how** to add a new component. It sets guardrails for contributors so tooling, CI, and operations can rely on a consistent layout. For quality workflows refer to `docs/ci-cd.md`; for runtime operations see `docs/operational-readiness.md`.

This service follows a polyrepo model: each deployable service is kept in its own repository. Shared utilities must be published as standalone Go modules and consumed via versioned tags; never import code directly from another service with `replace` directives.

## Directory Template

Every new component or generated artifact must live under one of the predefined roots. The tree below shows the canonical layout (omitting temporary files and build artifacts):

```
searchService/
├── api/                 # API contracts (OpenAPI/proto) and schemas
│   └── proto/           # Protobuf sources compiled by Buf

│   └── server/main.go
├── config/              # Default configuration (override via env)

```

## Guardrails

- Only files under `internal/` may depend on adapters or repositories; keep business logic behind `internal/service`.
- Generated code always lives under `gen/` and must never be edited manually. Regenerate via `buf generate` followed by `go generate` when applicable.
- New APIs require updates in **both** `api/proto` and the corresponding adapter/service packages before implementation work starts.
- Tests are mandatory for new features:
  - Unit tests in the closest package (e.g., `internal/service/..._test.go`).
  - Integration tests in `tests/integration` when an external system (Elasticsearch, Qdrant, Kafka) is involved.
- Automation defaults:
  - `make lint` runs `golangci-lint`.
  - `make test-unit` executes `go test -race ./...`.
  - `make test-integration` runs tagged integration suites (`testcontainers-go`).

Keep this template in sync with the CI pipeline and developer onboarding docs whenever the structure changes.
